I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, where I swam competitively for 10 years and fell in love
with learning. From 2016 to 2020 I was in the Los Angeles area while attending
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd College</a>,
where I double majored and earned a Bachelor's of Science degree in Computer Science and Visual Art.
Currently, I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student with a focus on Computer Graphics at
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.sfu.ca/">Simon Fraser University</a>
in the Vancouver area. Within graphics, I am presently most interested in physically-based animation and
geometric modeling. I'm constantly amazed by how math, science, and art come
together in order to represent the world around us in a meaningful way.
