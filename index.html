<h1>Hello, world!</h1>

<p>Welcome to my collection of academic endeavors, personal projects, and random musings.
  Outside of my academic interests, I'm also passionate about</p>

<ul>
  <li>social equity</li>
  <li>the environment and sustainability</li>
  <li>mental health awareness</li>
  <li>swimming, running, and hiking</li>
  <li>plants and gardening</li>
  <li>cooking and baking</li>
  <li>DIY and crafting</li>
  <li>cats</li>
</ul>

<div>I'm on a life-long journey of learning and growth, and I'm excited to see where I'll go!</div>

<p>I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, where I swam competitively for 10 years and fell in love
with learning. </p><p> From 2016 to 2020 I was in the Los Angeles area while attending
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd College</a>,
through which I double majored and earned a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and Visual Art.</p><p>
Currently, I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student with a focus on Computer Graphics at
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.sfu.ca/">Simon Fraser University</a>
in the Vancouver area, under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~elf/">Eugene Fiume</a>.
Within graphics, I am presently most interested in physically-based animation and
geometric modeling. I'm constantly amazed by how math, science, and art can come
together in order to represent the world around us in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, I have had the pleasure of interning as a software engineer at several different companies, including the following:</p>

<ul class="spaced-list">
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://unity.com/">Unity Technologies</a>, which provides a real-time 3D development platform</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ea.com/news/inside-the-studio-dice-la">DICE LA</a>, an Electronic Arts game studio</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vrbo.com/">HomeAway (VRBO)</a>, which offers a web interface for renting out homes</li>
</ul>

<p>For a capstone project through Harvey Mudd College, I have also worked for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.llnl.gov/">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> on GPU-accelerated visualization of high-order physics simulation meshes.</p>

<div>Please contact me at juliahread [at] gmail [dot] com for more details on these experiences.
  Although I am presently in the world of academia, I enjoy contributing to applied projects and hope to continue to do so in the future.</div>
